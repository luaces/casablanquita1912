The village itself is a jewel of traditional architecture, with church, hermitage and the famous Roman bridge that crosses the river Meruelo and is crossed, in turn, each year by thousands of pilgrims who immediately enter its famous Calle Real, Camino de Santiago.

It is also a great place to spend a few days or a vacation, as it has many services, stores, tourist office, pharmacy, tennis courts, soccer, basketball, and a great river swimming pool in the same area of the Roman bridge.
Famous are its wineries, and there is also a wide variety of restaurants and places to stay overnight (hotels, rural houses and hostels).
